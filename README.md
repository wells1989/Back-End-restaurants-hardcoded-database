Mini practice project, creating REST API endpoints for the restaurant and starred restaurant endpoints (NOTE: As this was a practice project focusing on successfully creating API routes the data was locally created, instead of using a database such as PostgresSQL.)

The remaining project files (e.g. front-end etc) were not included as they were part of the starting package and hence the only files I worked with were the files which have been attached
